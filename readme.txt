* This plugin get markdown file path on dropbox public link or github raw content url. It convert markdown file to html, and put it to post content.
* You can update post **by editing file on your computer with dropbox sync feature.** Or you can update post **by push your content to github**. Of course, you can edit directly from github website.
* If post was updated once, plugin check only URL server's ETAG not full content. It is for speed. If ETAG was changed, plugin get new content and update post content. Or do nothing.
* Plugin only pass converted html content to editor. Saving is WordPress's work. So revision history is preserved.
* Plugin's compatibility is good. Because this plugin updates only post content html. This doesn't touch `the_content` process(vary plugins touch the process).
* You can use [markdown extra syntax](http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/).
* It provide markdown editor that can use in post editing page instead of url.


= Notice about Dropbox =

This plugin use dropbox 'Public link' not 'Share link'. Currently only Dropbox Pro and Business users may enable Public folders. Below is a example.

- (Public link)[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15546257/test.md]
- (Share link)[https://www.dropbox.com/s/rgin3gbpa5y0505/test.md?dl=0]

If you are Pro and Business user, [visit this page to 'enable public folder'.](https://www.dropbox.com/enable_public_folder)

If you are not, you can use GitHub, instead.


= Logic =

#### On admin page ####

On admin write page, put markdown url path. And click 'update editor' button. So markdown content converted to html is putted to editor. [See screenshot 1](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mytory-markdown/screenshots/).

#### On view page ####

This plugin get file url(Dropbox public link is recommended). And save header's etag to postmeta and converted html to post_content. Next time on request same post, first this plugin olny get dropbox http etag. If changed etag, get dropbox md content and save again, or get html from post_content.

= This plugin divide title and content from md file =

If markdown file has `h1` this plugin puts first `h1` string to post_title. Of course, remove the `h1` from post_content so don't print title twice.
